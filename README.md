* Message that tells particular item has been dispensed
### advance applications:
* categorizing an item
* allowing user to buy additional item
* Handelling errors
* recommending user to purchase related item(ex: if you would buy milk, programm would sugges to buy cookie)
### Things I made:
* All from the above
